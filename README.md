# Online Store
---
This is my first Node.js application which is a simple e-commerce website where a seller can display their products and manage customers orders.

## Technologies used
---
Since this application was my first attempt at _backend development_, the _frontend_ was kept simple and basic.
- #### Technologies:
   - HTML
   - Bootstrap
    - Node.js
    - Express
    - MongoDB
    - EJS

## Setup
---
You need to have MongoDB installed and then simply `git clone` the repository and run `npm install` and then run `node index.js`.
To create an admin account, signup for an account and then change the _`isAdmin`_ property of the document in the MongoDB database under the collection called `users`.

## Deployed version
---
I have also deployed the app on free subscriptions of Heroku MongoDB Atlas and you can check it out here: [Alganzory Online Store](https://alganzory-online-store.herokuapp.com/)
You can login on the store as an admin using `admin@admin.com` and `admin123`
